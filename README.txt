LWP-Protocol-Coro-http

Coro is a cooperating multitasking system. This means
it requires some amount of cooperation on the part of
user code in order to provide parallelism.

This module makes LWP more cooperative by plugging
in an HTTP and HTTPS protocol implementor powered by
AnyEvent::HTTP.

All LWP features and configuration options should still be
available when using this module.
